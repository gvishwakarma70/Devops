I have created JSON code for 3-tier envionment with below resources:

1. Virtual Network (1 resource):
 This is the network infrastructure that provides connectivity and isolation for our environment.

2. Subnets (3 resources):
We have three subnets for each tier: presentation, application, and data.

3. Virtual Machines ( 6 resources):
 We have 6 virtual machines, 2 for each tier
 Each tier have 2 virtual machines and use load balancing.

4. Network Interfaces (6 resources):
 Each virtual machine requires a network interface to connect to the virtual network and subnets.

5. Network Security Groups (3 resources):
 We use network security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic for each tier.

7. Azure Load Balancers for each tier.

Thanks
